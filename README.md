# Variational Autoencoder & Conditional Variational Autoencoder using MNIST dataset
Conditional VAE using CNN on MNIST in PyTorch.

---

Inorder to run Variational autoencoder use train_vae.py and for Conditional Variational Autoencoder use train_cvae.py. Both of these 2 implementations uses CNN. For other details such as latent space size, learning rate, CNN layers, batch_size etc. see the code.
